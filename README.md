# Week 4: Collection Interface

## 📅 Day 1 – Java Generics
**(Date: 15-Jan-2026)**
**(Focus: Understanding Generics for Type-Safe Collections)**

- Understood how generics improve code reusability, readability, and compile-time checking.
- Learned how generic classes, methods, and interfaces work with collections like List, Set, and Map.
- Focused on applying generics effectively to write clean, robust, and maintainable collection-based code.
- Explored bounded type parameters, wildcards (? extends, ? super), and their use cases.
- Studied Java Generics in detail to understand how they provide type safety and reduce runtime errors in collections.

## 📅 Day 2 – Java Collections
**(Date: 16-Jan-2026)**
**(Focus: Writing Clean & Professional Java Code)**

- Studied the Java Collections Framework covering List, Set, Queue, and Map interfaces.
- Explored List implementations such as ArrayList and LinkedList for ordered and index-based data storage.
- Learned Set implementations like HashSet and TreeSet to handle unique elements and sorted collections.
- Studied Map implementations such as HashMap and TreeMap for efficient key–value data storage and retrieval.
- Focused on choosing the right collection type based on performance, ordering, and use-case requirements.
