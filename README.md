## 📅 Day 16 – Stack, Queue, Hashmap, and HashFunction  
**(Date: 03-Jan-2025)**
**(Focus: Learning Stack, Queue, Hashmap and Hashfunction with proper implementation)**

- Stack:  
  - Follows LIFO(Last In First Out) principle
  - push, pop, peek operations

- Queue:
  - Follows FIFO(First In First Out) principle
  - enqueue, dequeue, peek operations

- Hashmap:
  - Stores key–value pairs and uses unique keys
  - Fast insertion and retrieval

- Hashfunction:
  - Converts keys into index values
  - Helps in fast data access

## 📅 Day 17 – Sorting Algorithms
**(Date: 05-Jan-2025)**
- Learned to arrange elements in ascending or descending order
- Implemented common algorithms like:
  - Bubble sort
  - Merge sort
  - Heap sort
  - Insertion sort
  - Selection sort
  - Counting sort
  - Quick sort
- Compared elements and swapped them to achieve correct order

## 📅 Day 18 – Linear Search and Binary Search, StringBuilder, StringBuffer, BufferedReader, FileReader, InputStreamReader
**(Date: 06-Jan-2025)**
**(Focus: Learning and implementation)**

- Linear Search & Binary Search:  
  - Linear Search: checks elements one by one
  - Binary Search: works on sorted data, divides search space

- StringBuilder & StringBuffer:
  - StringBuilder: faster, not thread-safe, mutable
  - StringBuffer: thread-safe, slower, mutable
    
- BufferedReader & FileReader:
  - BufferReader is used to read text efficiently and it wraps another reader for better performance
  - FileReader is used to read data from files and it reads character-by-character or line-by-line
    
- InputStreamReader:
  - Converts byte streams to character streams
  - Commonly used with System.in

## 📅 Day 19 – Algorithm's Runtime Analysis & Big-O Notation
**(Date: 07-Jan-2026)**

- Runtime Analysis: Learned how the algorithm's execution time grows as the input size grow
- Big-O Notation: Understood Big-O notation that represents the upper bound of an algorithm’s time or space growth with respect to input size
- Cases: Worst, Average, and Best cases describe the maximum, expected, and minimum performance of an algorithm for different inputs
- Optimizing Java code involves choosing efficient algorithms and data structures to reduce time and space complexity
- Time Complexity Analysis: measures the number of operations an algorithm performs relative to the input size
- Space Complexity Analysis: determines the amount of extra memory an algorithm requires during execution
