## 📅 Day 10 – Java Constructors, Instance vs. Class Variables, Access Modifiers 
**(Date: 27-Dec-2025)**
**(Focus: Writing Clean & Professional Java Code)**

- Learned different types of constructors (default and parameterized).
- Differentiated between instance variables and class (static) variables.
- Practiced using static variables and methods.
- Learned various access modifiers (public, private, protected, default).

- Started writing Java code in a **professional and industry-standard manner**, following:
  - Proper **naming conventions** (class names, variables, methods)
  - Clean and readable **indentation**
  - Meaningful **comments** for better understanding
  - Structured and consistent **code formatting**

- Gained hands-on experience in organizing programs for better **maintainability and readability**.

## 📅 Day 11 – this, static, final key words and instanceof operator
**(Date: 29-Dec-2025)**
- Learned the usage of the this keyword to refer to current class objects.
- Understood the purpose of the static keyword for variables, methods, and blocks.
- Learned the role of the final keyword with variables, methods, and classes.
- Wrote programs to verify object–class relationships using instanceof.
