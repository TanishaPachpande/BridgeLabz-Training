# Week 6: Java 8 features

## 📅 Day 1 – Lambda Expression, Functional Interface, Method reference and Marker Interface  
**(Date: 27-Jan-2025)**
**(Focus: Functional Programming Enhancements in Java 8)**

- Studied Java 8 functional programming concepts to write cleaner, more expressive, and efficient Java code.
- Learned Lambda Expressions to reduce boilerplate code and implement functional interfaces in a concise manner.
- Explored Functional Interfaces such as Runnable, Callable, Comparator, and custom functional interfaces using @FunctionalInterface.
- Practiced Method References (static, instance, and constructor references) to improve readability and reuse existing methods.
- Applied Java 8 features in practical examples to simplify logic, improve maintainability, and follow modern Java coding standards.
- Focused on building a strong foundation for Streams API, collections processing, and functional-style programming.

## 📅 Day 2 – Java 8 Streams API And Collectors
**(Date: 28-Jan-2025)**
**(Focus: Data Processing with Streams, forEach & Collectors)**

- Studied the Java 8 Streams API to process collections in a declarative and functional style.
- Learned how streams work as a pipeline consisting of source, intermediate operations, and terminal operations.
- Explored the forEach() method to iterate over collections and streams using lambda expressions.
- Practiced intermediate operations such as filter(), map(), sorted(), and distinct() for data transformation.
- Understood Collectors and their role in collecting stream results into lists, sets, maps, and grouped data.
- Worked with commonly used collectors like toList(), toSet(), toMap(), groupingBy(), and counting().

## 📅 Day 3 – Java8: Scenario-Based Practice  
**(Date: 28-Jan-2025)**
**(Focus: Annotations, Reflection, CSV & JSON Data Handling)**

- Applied these concepts in the Smart City Transport System to filter schedules, display live services, and analyze passenger trips using Streams and Collectors.
- Focused on writing clean, readable, and efficient functional-style Java 8 code for real-world scenarios.
